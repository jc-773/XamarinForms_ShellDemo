# XamarinForms_ShellDemo
In this repository I have demonstrated some Xamarin Shell features

Some benefits of using Shell:
  - Allows a single place to describe the visual hierarchy of an application
  - Provides a common navigation user experience
  - Supports URI based navigation schema 
  - Shell increases the rendering speed 
  - Reduces the memory consumption 


In this branch I have examples using FlyoutItem and TabBar shell features
To switch, just uncomment the main page you desire

Implicit conversion auto wraps each content page object in a shell content object, then wrapping it in either a tab object or flyout object
